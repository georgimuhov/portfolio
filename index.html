        <h2>Java Rules</h2><br><br><br>
        <p>
            -OCA 1Z0-808-<br><br>

            Abstract Class Definition Rules:<br><br>
            1.	Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.<br>
            2.	Abstract classes may be defined with any number, including zero, of abstract and non-abstract methods.<br>
            3.	Abstract classes may not be marked as private, protected or final.<br>
            4.	An abstract class that extends another abstract class inherits all of its abstract methods as its own abstract methods.<br>
            5.	The first concrete class that extends an abstract class must provide an implementation for all of the inherited abstract methods.<br><br>

            Abstract Method Definition Rules:<br><br>
            1.	Abstract methods may only be defined in abstract classes.<br>
            2.	Abstract methods may be not declared private or final.<br>
            3.	Abstract methods must not provide a method body/implementation in the abstract class for which is it declared.<br>
            4.	Implementing an abstract method in a subclass follows the same rules for overriding a method. For example, the name and signatures must be the same, and  the visibility of the method in the subclass must be at least as accessible as the method in the parent class.<br><br>

            Access Modifiers:<br><br>
            1.	Private: Only accessible within the same class<br>
            2.	Default (package private) access: private and other classes in the same package<br>
            3.	Protected: default access and child classes<br>
            4.	Public: protected and classes in the other packages<br><br>

            Casting Variables:<br><br>
            1.	Casting an object from a subclass to a superclass doesn’t require an explicit cast.<br>
            2.	Casting an object from a superclass to a subclass requires an explicit cast.<br>
            3.	The compiler will not allow casts to unrelated types (int != double).<br>
            4.	Even when the code compiles without issue, an exception may be thrown at runtime if the object 
                being cast is not actually an instance of that class.<br><br>

            Child Classes:<br><br>
            1.	The method in the child class must have the same signature as the method in the parent class.<br>
            2.	The method in the child class must be at least as accessible or more accessible that the method in the parent class.<br>
            3.	The method in the child class may not throw a checked exception that 
                is new or broader that the class of any exception thrown in the parent class method.<br>
            4.	If the method returns a value, it must be the same or a subclass of the method in the parent class, known as covariant return types.<br>
            5.	The method defined in the child class must be marked as static if it is marked as static in the parent 
                class (method hiding). Likewise, the method must not be marked as static in the child class if it is not marked
                as static in the parent class (method overriding).<br><br>

            Constructor Definition Rules:<br><br>
            1.	The first statement of every constructor is a call to another constructor within the class using this(), 
                or a call to a constructor in the direct parent class using super().<br>
            2.	The super() call may not be used after the first statement of the constructor.<br>
            3.	If not super() call is declared in a constructor, Java will insert a no-argument super() as the first statement of the constructor.<br>
            4.	If the parent doesn’t have a no-argument constructor and the child doesn’t define any constructors, 
                the compiler will throw an error and try to insert a default no-argument constructor into the child class.<br>
            5.	If the parent doesn’t have a no-argument constructor, the compiler requires an explicit call to a parent
                constructor in each child constructor.<br><br>
            
            Exceptions:<br><br>
            1.	Runtime exception – Subclass of RuntimeException – OkToCatch – Handle not required.<br>
            2.	Checked exception – Subclass of Exception but not subclass of RuntimeException – OkToCatch – Handle is required.<br>
            3.	Error – Subclass of Error – NotOkToCatch – Handle not required.<br><br>

            Interface:<br><br>
            -Interface is a specialized kind of abstract class-<br><br>
            1.	Interfaces cannot be instantiated directly.<br>
            2.	An interface is not required to have any methods.<br>
            3.	An interface may not be marked as final!<br>
            4.	All top-level interfaces are assumed to have public or default access; 
                they may include the abstract modifiers in their definition. Therefore, 
                marking an interface as private, protected or final will trigger a compiler error, since this is incompatible with these assumptions.<br>
            5.	All nondefault methods in an interface are assumed to have the modifiers abstract and public 
                in their definition. Therefore, marking a method as private, protected, or final will trigger compiler errors as these are 
                incompatible with the abstract and public keywords.<br><br>

            Interface Variables:<br><br>
            1.	Interface variables are assumed to be public, static and final. Therefore, marking a variable as private or protected 
                will trigger a compiler error, as will marking any variable as abstract.<br>
            2.	The value of an interface variable must be set when is it declared since it is marked as final.<br>

            In this manner, interface variables are essentially constant variables defined on the interface level. <br><br>


            Default Interface:<br><br>
            1.	A default method may only be declared within an interface and not within a class or abstract class.<br>
            2.	A default method must be marked with the default keyword. If a method is marked as default, it must provide a method body.<br>
            3.	A default method is not assumed to be static, final, or abstract, 
                as it may be used or overridden by a class that implements the interface.<br>
            4.	Like all methods in an interface, a default method is assumed to be public and will not compile if marked as private or protected.<br><br>

            Logical Operators:<br><br>
            1.	AND &  is only true if both operands are true.<br>
            2.	Inclusive OR | is only false if both operands are false.<br>
            3.	Exclusive OR ^ is only true if the operands are different.<br><br>

            Variables Order:<br><br>
            1.	If there is a superclass, initialize it first.<br>
            2.	Static variables declarations and static initializers in the order they appear in the file.<br>
            3.	Instance variable declarations and instance initializers in the order they appear in the file.<br>
            4.	The constructor.<br><br>
